#📚 Library Catalog — Java OOP Practice Project

---

A Java console-based application built to practice fundamental object-oriented programming concepts, including:

- Inheritance

- Polymorphism

- Abstract classes

- Interfaces

- Exceptions

- Composition

- File I/O

- Modular project structure

This project represents an intermediate Java exercise, designed to reinforce backend design patterns and multi-class architecture — not a production system.

---

##🚀 Purpose

The goal of this app is to simulate a simplified library media system where users can:

- Add, view, borrow, and return media items

- Browse books, movies, and audiobooks

- Trigger type-specific behaviors such as preview(), download(), and consume()

- Search and filter catalog items (IN PROGRESS)

- Store and load catalog data

This project was created as a learning exercise, focusing on clean architecture, class relationships, and Java fundamentals.

##📌 Notes

This project is intentionally console-based to reinforce:

- thinking in objects

- designing class hierarchies

- separating concerns

- working without frameworks

It is published in GitHub as part of a practice / learning portfolio, not as a production-level application.
